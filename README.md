### Hi!
I'm a mechanical engineering student. I code simulations to recreate, observe, understand and analyze engineering designs or natural physical systems in the digital universe. I have a special interest in astronomy and space technologies, and I enjoy programming a lot.

Sometimes, I code other fun projects as well, such as those related to music composition. Open source ftw.

I can code in Python, C or C++.

[orbitSim3D](https://github.com/arda-guler/orbitSim3D) is an astrodynamics/space mission simulator and is my current "flagship" programming project, as is its sister project [Kozmoworks](https://github.com/arda-guler/Kozmoworks).
