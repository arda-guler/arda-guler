### Hi!
I'm an undergraduate mechanical engineering student. I code simulations to recreate, observe, understand and analyze engineering designs or natural physical systems in the digital universe. I have a special interest in astronomy and space technologies, and I enjoy coding a lot. Especially when my code actually works.

Sometimes, I code other fun projects as well, such as those related to music composition. Open source projects are the best!

I can code in Python, C or C++. Fortran is also fine, but it's probably about time to let go of that one.

[orbitSim3D](https://github.com/arda-guler/orbitSim3D) is probably my "flagship" programming project.
