### Hi!
I usually create simulations to recreate, observe, understand and analyze natural physical systems or engineering designs in the digital universe. I have a special interest in astronomy and space technologies, and I enjoy programming a lot.

Sometimes, I create other fun projects as well, such as those related to art and music. Open source ftw.

I can use Python, C or C++ with relative confidence, and I am somewhat familiar with Lua and x86 Assembly (for typical home-computer architecture). I can use MATLAB too, but given the opportunity, I'd prefer using Python to do anything MATLAB can do.

[orbitSim3D](https://github.com/arda-guler/orbitSim3D) is an astrodynamics/space mission simulator and is my current "flagship" programming project.
